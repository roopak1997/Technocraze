Hi!

This project titled "Decentralised management of clinical trials and drug traceability" is a proof of concept to convert the clinical trial management system into a blockchain based system. We use the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network and a NodeJS application to achieve this.

Directory Structure :   
  
/fabric-network  
Contains the Fabric network creation scripts.  
  
/network-explorer  
A clone of the blockchain-explorer repo to visualise the fabric network and blockchain history  
  
/web-application  
A NodeJS application that serves as the clnical trial management system.
